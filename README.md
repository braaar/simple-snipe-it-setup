This repo contains the basic necessities for getting [snipe-it](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it) up and running.

# Configure

This server can run locally for demo/testing purposes as is.

To do so, you must have Docker and docker-compose installed.

To run SnipeIT, somply run

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Then you can open up `http:localhost:8081` and go through SnipeIT's setup to get things up and running. 
After that you will be able to use the software, but only locally.
